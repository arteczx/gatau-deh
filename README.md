# JAXA Kibo-RPC Space Robot Programming Challenge

## Project Overview
This repository contains code for the JAXA Kibo-RPC competition, where participants program Astrobee robots to perform autonomous missions on the International Space Station.

## Key Features
- Optimized path planning with safety checks for Keep In Zones (KIZ) and Keep Out Zones (KOZ)
- Multi-threaded execution for concurrent movement and image processing
- AR marker detection using OpenCV and ArUco markers
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Efficient caching and resource management

## Technical Details

### Navigation & Safety
- Implements boundary checking for KIZ/KOZ zones
- Path safety validation with acceleration and thrust limits
- Safe waypoint system for obstacle avoidance
- Quaternion-based orientation control

### Computer Vision
- AR marker detection using ArUco library
- Optimized image processing with adaptive thresholding
- Image caching for improved performance
- Camera calibration handling

### Concurrency
- Multi-threaded execution using ExecutorService
- Parallel movement and image processing
- Thread-safe data structures
- Proper resource cleanup

### Error Handling
- Retry mechanisms for movement commands
- Timeout handling for operations
- Graceful failure recovery
- Comprehensive error logging
